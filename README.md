# Climbing Crag Recommendations

Find a crag in the area which suits your style, grade, and travel time. Runs as a [Jupyter notbeook](https://jupyter.org/) and uses data from [27Crags](27crags.com/).

## Usage

- `pipenv install`
- `pipenv shell`
- `jupyter notebook`
- Adjust environment variables as desired, run all cells

Note: to fetch distance information through google maps api you would need api key, it's enough to create free account.
